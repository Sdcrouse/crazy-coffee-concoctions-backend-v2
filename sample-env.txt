Notes:

1. 5000 is the default PORT used by this application; it can be changed if need be.
2. A higher number is recommended for the SALT_ROUNDS value.
3. You may need a different MYSQL_HOST value depending on your operating system. For Windows operating systems, e.g., use '172.18.160.1'.
4. Do NOT change the MYSQL_DB value! This is the name of the database that the src/databases/schema.sql file uses.
5. It is HIGHLY recommended that you update the other fields with your own (ideally more secure) values. Be sure to leave the '' quotes around them.
